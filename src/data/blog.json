This study surveys current and potential meal kit customers and predicts optimal meal kit choices using statistical and machine learning techniques, including user- and item-based collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning approaches. The large number of potential customers who sampled a small percentage of meal kit options presents a challenge in generating optimal predictions. This study implements and discusses the advancement of web-survey methodology and evaluates prediction methods when dealing with sparse data, with the goal of providing an optimal model for predicting consumer meal kit service choices.",
